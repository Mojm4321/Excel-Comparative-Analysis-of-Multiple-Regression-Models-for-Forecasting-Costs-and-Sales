# Comparative-Analysis-of-Multiple-Regression-Models-for-Forecasting-Costs-and-Sales

# Introduction
Multiple regression allows us to explore the relationships between a dependent variable and several independent variables, providing insights into which factors most influence the target outcome.

This report aims to compare the forecasting abilities of three multiple regression models and identify which is most effective for its specific scenario. This evaluation focuses on analysing the performance of each model in predicting outcomes across different business contexts.

The first model predicts taxi rides costs based on distance travelled, duration of the tax ride and age of the passengers. The second model assesses the drivers of monthly production costs for different manufactured goods - specifically tables, chairs, doors and fridges. The third model forecasts sales performance of a song based on airplay frequency, product attractiveness and advertising expenditure. 

The accuracy and performance of these models are judged using three main facotrs: Adjusted RÂ², which tell us how well the model explains the variation in the data; P-values, which shows how important each factor is in predicting the outcome and Scatter plots, which provide a visual check to see how well the predictions match the actual data and help identify any outliers that don't fit the pattern.
